# Car-Price-Prediction-model
This project leverages machine learning models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoostâ€”to accurately predict the selling prices of used cars based on key features like odometer, year, make, trim, and transmission.
# Highlights
- Advanced Model Comparison: Includes evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and baseline metrics to benchmark performance.
- Clean Data Pipeline: Handles messy datasets with feature engineering, outlier removal, and optimized memory usage for large-scale training.
- Business-Friendly Visuals: Power BI and Excel dashboards communicate key insights like brand resale value and feature importance.
  
This project reflects my passion for turning raw data into actionable insights, combining technical depth with user-centered design. Built for real-world impact in automotive pricing.
